# Technical Details
Following definitions are used in the rest of the spec to refer to a particular category or service.
| Service  | Service Resolver | Description
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Push Tokens Registration | backend.epns.io/apis/pushtokens | The service authenticates and registers push device tokens (not crypto token) to a wallet, it also is responsible to updating and deleting these tokens |
| Push Dispatch | pushdispatch.epns.io | This service works on the server and only accepts request coming from the server itself, it is responsible for sending push notications out and handling deleting of tokens via pushregister.epns.io |
| Push Listener | pushlisten.epns.io | This service creates a websocket to [Infura socket api](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/RPC-PUB-SUB), it listens for **App Owners** creation, updation and keeps track of messages of **App Owner Groups**, it also keeps on building a cache of users in **App Owner Groups** which the *Push Dispatch* can use to create messages. To learn more about these terminologies, head to [EPNS General Specs](https://github.com/ethereum-push-notification-system/epns-specs/blob/master/README.md) |

**Note:** Learn about [Apple Device Tokens](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/registering_your_app_with_apns) or [Google Device Tokens](https://developers.google.com/web/ilt/pwa/introduction-to-push-notifications) used for Push Notificaiton.
